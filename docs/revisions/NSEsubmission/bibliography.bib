abstract = {The periods, relative abundances, and absolute yields of delayed neutrons from “fast” fission of six nuclides (235U, 233U, 238U, 240Pu, and 232Th) and thermal fission of three nuclides (235U, 233U, and 239Pu) have been measured. “Godiva,” the bare 235U metal assembly at Los Alamos, was the neutron source. Six exponential periods were found necessary and sufficient for optimum least-squares fit to the data. Despite evident perturbations, general agreement among delayed neutron periods was obtained for all nuclides. Measured absolute total yields in delayed neutrons per fission (for the pure isotopes) are: 235U : 0·0165 ± 0.0005 239Pu: 0·0063 ± 0·0003233U : 0·0070 ± 0.0004 240Pu : 0·0088 ± 0.0006239U : 0·0412 ± 0.0017 232Th: 0·0496 ± 0·0020Representative of general delayed neutron periods (half-lives) and abundances are the 235U fast-fission data: Half-life (sec)Relative abundance54·51 ± 0·940·038 ± 0·00321·84 ± 0·540·213 ± 0·0056·00 ± 0·170·188 ± 0·0162·23 ± 0·060·407 ± 0·0070·496 ± 0·290·128 ± 0·0080·179 ± 0·0170·026 ± 0·003 These data have been corroborated in detail by independent period vs. reactivity measurements on the “Godiva” assembly.

abstract = {Beta-delayed neutron emission is important for nuclear structure and astrophysics as well as for reactor applications. Significant advances in nuclear experimental techniques in the past two decades have led to a wealth of new measurements that remain to be incorporated in the databases. We report on a coordinated effort to compile and evaluate all the available β-delayed neutron emission data. The different measurement techniques have been assessed and the data have been compared with semi-microscopic and microscopic-macroscopic models. The new microscopic database has been tested against aggregate total delayed neutron yields, time-dependent group parameters in 6-and 8-group re-presentation, and aggregate delayed neutron spectra. New recommendations of macroscopic delayed-neutron data for fissile materials of interest to applications are also presented. The new Reference Database for Beta-Delayed Neutron Emission Data is available online at: http://www-nds.iaea.org/beta-delayed-neutron/database.html.}

abstract={Up to 1300 nuclides are yielded in fission. Of these, 271 have been identified as precursors for delayed neutron emission. An extensive reference library of delayed neutron data has been compiled which contains fission yields and branchings, delayed neutron emission probabilities and spectra for each of these 271 precursor nuclides. The emphasis of the present work has been in improving the spectral data. Experimental spectra from laboratories in the United States, Germany, and Sweden have been incorporated in this evaluation. The experimental spectra have been augmented with model calculations such that the spectra included in the final library extend over the full theoretical energy range for delayed neutron emission. Models were also used to predict spectra for nuclides with no measured data. The data compiled in the precursor library have been used to calculate the aggregate behavior of delayed neutrons for the 43 fissioning systems having evaluated fission yields. Delayed neutron activities predicted using the explicit precursor data have also been approximated by three, six, nine and twelve time-groups using least squares techniques. The fitted six group data, being the more conventional representation, were also used to predict a consistent set of six-group spectra. Comparisons with the University of Lowell's recently published measurements of $\sp{235}$U delay interval spectra were also made. Beta-effective calculations for a simple Godiva system were performed and were compared to the experimental value. The point reactor kinetics equations were modified to accommodate the data in the precursor library. Both the explicit data and the group data were used to calculate the kinetic response of a reactor to step changes in reactivity. The precursor data and the six-group data are intended for inclusion in the next version of the Evaluated Nuclear Data Files, ENDF/B-VI.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the calculation of the effective delayed neutron fraction (βeff) in circulating-fuel nuclear reactors. The Molten Salt Fast Reactor is adopted as test case for the comparison of the analytical, deterministic and Monte Carlo methods presented. The Monte Carlo code SERPENT-2 has been extended to allow for delayed neutron precursors drift, according to the fuel velocity field. The forward and adjoint eigenvalue multi-group diffusion problems are implemented and solved adopting the multi-physics tool-kit OpenFOAM, by taking into account the convective and turbulent diffusive terms in the precursors balance. These two approaches show good agreement in the whole range of the MSFR operating conditions. An analytical formula for the circulating-to-static conditions βeff correction factor is also derived under simple hypotheses, which explicitly takes into account the spatial dependence of the neutron importance. Its accuracy is assessed against Monte Carlo and deterministic results. The effects of in-core recirculation vortex and turbulent diffusion are finally analysed and discussed.}

abstract = {The basic nuclear data of the latest releases of ENDF/B-VI were used in preliminary calculations with the CINDER'90 nuclide inventory code to simulate the activity of fission delayed-neutron precursors. Total delayed-neutron production was obtained at times during and following pulse (0.1-ms) and equilibrium (4-hr) fission histories for each of the sixty fission systems having fission-product yields in ENDF/B-VI. The equilibrium studies — at unit fission rate for constant fission periods sufficiently long that all precursors reached saturation inventories — yielded the vd value for each system. Delayed-neutron production rates at 54 decay times t, extending to 500 s following a fission pulse, were fit using the STEPIT code to the pulse function R(t) = ∑aiλie−λit. Results following equilibrium irradiations were fit to the equilibrium function R(∞, t) = ∑aiλie−λit. It was observed that functions from fits to pulse results did not well represent equilibrium results at long cooling times. Similarly, functions fit to the equilibrium results did not well represent pulse results at short cooling times. A comprehensive series of CINDER'90 calculations was then made for irradiation times T of 0.1 ms, 1 s, 10 s, 100 s, 1000 s, and 4 hours; results were obtained at 60 decay times t extending to 800 s following irradiation. Comprehensive calculations were made using both the 1989 Pn data of England and Brady and the new Pn data of Pfeiffer, Kratz and Möller described elsewhere in this issue. The body of results for each system was included in fits to obtain the neutron production rate R(T, t) = ∑aie−λit(1 − e−λiT) for each system. Fits were made for the traditional sum of six exponentials, with all variables free to vary; additional fits were made for a sum of eight exponentials with decay constants set to values suggested by Piksaikin. The resulting pulse functions R(t), defined by the ai and λi thus obtained, accurately represent calculated delayed-neutron production when integrated with any irradiation history. The pulse functions thus produced and other published pulse functions fit to past measurements and calculations are compared numerically at several times after fission. Reactivity effects of all functions from measurements and calculations for each of the sixty systems are indicated by the asymptotic periods following positive 10¢– 50¢ reactivity steps simulated in point-reactor kinetics calculations using the AIREK-10 code.}

The evaluations benefit from recent experimental data obtained in the U.S. and Europe, and improvements in theory and simulation. Notable advances include updated evaluated data for light nuclei, structural materials, actinides, fission energy release, prompt fission neutron and γ-ray spectra, thermal neutron scattering data, and charged-particle reactions.

abstract = {Delayed neutrons, which are described by kinetic parameters, are significant for nuclear reactor operation as they make nuclear reactors controllable. Modern lattice physics codes such as TRITON and Polaris in SCALE code system, generate kinetic parameters for a given material composition. The calculation is performed by summation of the delayed neutron data for each precursor isotope and then weighting is performed by real and/or adjoint neutron spectrum. Quantifying uncertainties in the weighted kinetic parameters is important for assembly and core calculations. Understanding uncertainty in modeling scenarios involve kinetic parameters (e.g. transients), requires propagating uncertainty in the weighted kinetic parameters due to uncertainties in the fundamental nuclear data libraries, including delayed neutron data. In this work, uncertainty analysis of the homogenized (also called weighted or macroscopic) kinetic parameters has been performed using Sampler, a module in SCALE code system, to investigate the effect of fundamental nuclear and delayed neutron data uncertainties on the weighted kinetic parameters. Two major sources of uncertainties were considered: (1) fundamental nuclear data (i.e. cross-sections, fission yield, decay data) and (2) nuclide-dependent group-wise delayed neutron data based on reported experimental measurements. In this study, a new capability was developed through SCALE code system to allow propagation of delayed neutron data uncertainties. Preliminary analysis demonstrated 7\% uncertainty in βeff at Beginning of Life (BOL) and increased to 15\% after fuel burnup. Decay constant groups showed lower uncertainty than delayed neutron fraction groups, both at BOL and End of Life (EOL). Delayed neutron fraction responses showed high correlation to each other which is expected to be due to the cross-section covariances reported in SCALE data libraries as well as the normalization condition of the nuclide-dependent DNF. Different sources of U-235 delayed neutron data were compared, and the results showed that the uncertainty calculated by Tuttle data was bounded by other sources. The current study can be extended to calculate kinetic parameters and their uncertainties for more advanced LWR applications.}

abstract = {We describe the next generation general purpose Evaluated Nuclear Data File, ENDF/B-VII.0, of recommended nuclear data for advanced nuclear science and technology applications. The library, released by the U.S. Cross Section Evaluation Working Group (CSEWG) in December 2006, contains data primarily for reactions with incident neutrons, protons, and photons on almost 400 isotopes, based on experimental data and theory predictions. The principal advances over the previous ENDF/B-VI library are the following: (1) New cross sections for U, Pu, Th, Np and Am actinide isotopes, with improved performance in integral validation criticality and neutron transmission benchmark tests; (2) More precise standard cross sections for neutron reactions on H, 6Li, 10B, Au and for 235,238U fission, developed by a collaboration with the IAEA and the OECD/NEA Working Party on Evaluation Cooperation (WPEC); (3) Improved thermal neutron scattering; (4) An extensive set of neutron cross sections on fission products developed through a WPEC collaboration; (5) A large suite of photonuclear reactions; (6) Extension of many neutron- and proton-induced evaluations up to 150 MeV; (7) Many new light nucleus neutron and proton reactions; (8) Post-fission beta-delayed photon decay spectra; (9) New radioactive decay data; (10) New methods for uncertainties and covariances, together with covariance evaluations for some sample cases; and (11) New actinide fission energy deposition. The paper provides an overview of this library, consisting of 14 sublibraries in the same ENDF-6 format as the earlier ENDF/B-VI library. We describe each of the 14 sublibraries, focusing on neutron reactions. Extensive validation, using radiation transport codes to simulate measured critical assemblies, show major improvements: (a) The long-standing underprediction of low enriched uranium thermal assemblies is removed; (b) The 238U and 208Pb reflector biases in fast systems are largely removed; (c) ENDF/B-VI.8 good agreement for simulations of thermal high-enriched uranium assemblies is preserved; (d) The underprediction of fast criticality of 233,235U and 239Pu assemblies is removed; and (e) The intermediate spectrum critical assemblies are predicted more accurately. We anticipate that the new library will play an important role in nuclear technology applications, including transport simulations supporting national security, nonproliferation, advanced reactor and fuel cycle concepts, criticality safety, fusion, medicine, space applications, nuclear astrophysics, and nuclear physics facility design. The ENDF/B-VII.0 library is archived at the National Nuclear Data Center, BNL, and can be retrieved from www.nndc.bnl.gov.}

The previous U.K. evaluations have been published. In this paper we summarize the current status of the US evaluation, philosophy, and various integral yield tests for 34 fissioning nuclides at one or more neutron incident energies and/or for spontaneous fission. Currently there are 50 yield sets and for each we have independent and cumulative yields and uncertainties for approximately 1100 fission products. When finalized, the recommended data will become part of the next version of the US Evaluated Nuclear Data File (ENDF/B-VI). The complete set of data, including the basic input of measured yields, will be issued as a sequel to the General Electric evaluation reports (better known by the authors' names: Rider - or earlier - Meek and Rider). 16 references.},

	abstract = {Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs) are advanced reactors noted for strong passive safety features. They present unique challenges in multiphysics reactor modeling \& simulation arising from strong temperature reactivity feedback, delayed neutron precursor flow, and turbulent heat transport in fuel salt regions. Simulating the complex multiphysics interactions in MSRs requires robust, flexible, and highly scalable multiphysics software. Many MSR designs also still retain control rods which can complicate time-dependent reactivity-initiated transient simulations on reactor software relying on neutron diffusion theory. This work builds on existing capabilities in Moltres, a MOOSE-based MSR simulation software, to address these challenges and support efforts towards MSR deployment.
This work verified and validated existing multiphysics coupling capabilities in Moltres in two comparative studies. In both studies, Moltres showed good agreement with other MSR simulation tools involving coupled neutronics and thermal-hydraulics problems. This work also introduces a turbulence model in Moltres to support future MSR analyses involving turbulent delayed neutron precursor and temperature transport. Lastly, this work introduces a novel hybrid SN-diffusion method for accurate control rod modeling in time-dependent MSR simulations. The hybrid method combines the strengths of both approaches by generating transport corrections using the SN method near control rods. The SN and neutron diffusion solvers are coupled through an adaptive boundary coupling algorithm. This algorithm allows the solver to adapt to the transport correction parameters and preserve smooth neutron flux gradients across the interface. In 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D k-eigenvalue simulations, the hybrid method produced accurate control rod worth estimates, relative to reference neutron transport solutions and experimental data, at approximately four times the computational cost of the neutron diffusion method. The hybrid method also performed well in a time-dependent rod drop simulation by reproducing expected trends observed in experimental data. Analysis of its computational performance indicated the possibility of further optimizations beyond its current implementation. With the hybrid methods spatial resolution and efficient computational performance, Moltres could enable accurate and cost-effective simulations of asymmetric transients in MSRs.},
